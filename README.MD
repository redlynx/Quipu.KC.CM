# Minimal Custom Module
Quipu.KC.CM is a minimal template for a custom module for Kofax Capture.
There is a simple setup form, yet batch processing is up to you.


# AssemblyResolver
`KcAssemblyResolver` is a dedicated helper that makes sure all Kofax-related assemblies are resolved automatically.
As a result, no more binaries have to be duplicated.
